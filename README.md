Github Stars Repositories Manager

</div>

## ðŸŽ¯ Background

As the first social platform for developers, Github has countless excellent open source projects, which brings great convenience to work and study. When you encounter a project you need or like, just click Star to get it.

Star is easy, but as the number of Starred Repositories grows, it is inevitable that you canâ€™t remember the name of a certain project when you need to use it, and Github only provides a simple search, so finding the target Starred Repository has become a little troublesome.

Therefore, having your own Github Stars Repositories Manager is also a must-have for developers. ðŸ’¡

## Create a Github OAuth App

Go to Settings - Developer Settings - OAuth Apps.

![No OAuth application](https://github.com/cfour-hi/gitstars/assets/8335856/889537d1-ae6b-481a-b054-8802df9182e1)

Think of a name for your Vercel project first. In the example above, the project name is `gitstars-cfour-hi`, and the final Vercel project access URL will be [https://gitstars-cfour-hi.vercel.app](https://gitstars-cfour-hi.vercel.app).

Enter the access URL in both the Homepage URL and the Authorization callback URL fields.

After creation, the app settings page will open.
